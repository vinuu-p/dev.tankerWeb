## 💡 Why I Built This

My father was previously using a third-party, subscription-based service to manage his tanker business. When the service announced it would be shutting down and advised users to download their data, he shifted to using Google Keep as a temporary solution to log daily records.

To make the process more efficient, organized, and tailored to his workflow, I built this custom website based on his preferences and day-to-day needs.
